in the last 300 commits we had:
- 20 chore
- 7 enhancement
- 50 feat
- 85 fix
- 1 format
- 9 refactor










    HOTFIX: If an urgent fix is required
    feat: A new feature
    fix: A bug fix
    docs: Documentation only changes
    perf: A code change that improves performance
    test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    format: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc, linting)
    revert: Revert something
    update or upgrade: Update dependencies or pods or other related things
    refactor: A code change that keeps functionality mostly the same
    build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
    uxui: changes that affect how something looks or how the user experiences it
    cleanup: When the main change is removing code, old or unused
    other: catch-all, and once we have had a bunch of those, we can possibly make a new category


(keep chore in peril)
    chore: if what you did is actually a tedious thing that you dont like to do, use chore.
